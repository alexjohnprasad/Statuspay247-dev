                            <li>Posters must post each assigned status exactly as received without modifications.</li>
                            <li>Statuses should be posted within the time frame specified.</li>
                            <li>Deleting, modifying, or failing to post assigned statuses without valid reasons can result in payment deductions or termination.</li>
                            <li>If you are unable to post an assigned ad for any reason, you must contact the admin and explain your reason. If your reason is valid, the ad will be assigned to another poster. If your reason is not valid and you still do not post the ad, you will receive a warning. If this scenario is repeated, your account will be terminated without payment. Rejecting ads will slow down your earning process.</li>
